    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        In this module, you’ll step into the role of a software engineer, working with a client to identify their problems,
        and ask clarifying questions. By mastering this skill, you’ll be able to deliver solutions that solve real-world
        problems and make your clients happy.

        When developing software, coding isn't one of the most critical steps; it’s understanding what needs to be built.
        This process, known as requirements gathering, is how software engineers collaborate with clients to define the system's goals,
        features, and constraints. It is important to realize that requirements for a project will change over time,
        so failure to clarify and communicate with your client early on leads to wasted time, effort, and resources down the line.

        Requirements gathering is like building a map as you go on a journey. At the beginning, you and the client may only have
        a rough idea of the destination, with a few key landmarks along the way. As you continue to develop the project,
        new details and obstacles will emerge, changing the path to your destination.
