    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Pre-Activity: Budget Tracker Apps Overview</h1>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        In this activity, you will explore three different budget tracker apps, each with varying levels 
        of functionality and user experience. These apps represent real-world scenarios where different 
        aspects of design, usability, and software engineering practices come into play.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        You are expected to project a six-month budget using the tools provided. This will require you to 
        add recurring income and expenses, analyze each app's usability and performance, and reflect on 
        their shortcomings and strengths after completing each task. You’ll repeat the activity for three 
        different versions of the app and answer reflection questions along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the requirements on the right to set up your budget. Each requirement must be completed in 
        order to proceed to the next version of the app. If you don’t meet all the requirements, you won’t 
        be able to move forward.
    </p>
